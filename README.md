# Junk King II

## About

Junk King II is a school project made by 3 second year students from ESMAD in Vila do Conde in the course TSIW. The project is a game made for the web with THREE.js with the theme "Eco-Schools" and a little inspiration from Junk King I. The game consists of an endless "race" where the player must pick up a trash and reach the end of the level. The level is divided by 2 parts; the first is a giant hand that only does one thing, try to prevent the player from progressing, to do that, the hand will repeatedly punch the floor so the path becomes blocked. The second part contains a parkour, this means that the player must jump from one platform to another, if the player falls, he will have to start over. When the player reaches the end he must choose the correct container color to throw the trash in, if the player chooses the wrong container, he will have to start over. The game has a score system, the score is calculated by the amount of trash the player picks up in 2 minutes.

## How to play

The controls are very simple:

- "W" to move forward
- "S" to move backwards
- "D" to move to the right
- "A" to move to the left
- "Space" to jump
